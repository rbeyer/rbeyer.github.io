		Promontory on N rim jutting
		out into Coprates Chasma just west of the massif.
		(a) Portion of THEMIS VIS image V06856002.  The topmost 
					dark layer can be seen just below the plateau surface
					along the slopes to the west and along the south of 
					this promontory.  Additionally, the hummocky surface
					texture of the promontory can be seen here.
		(b) Portion of THEMIS nighttime IR image I08235013.  This
					image highlights the relative temperature differences
					at night between the hummocks and the lanes between them.
		(c) Portion of MOC image E03/01374.  This image shows the
					topmost strong layer that underlies the hummocky surface
					here.
		(d) MDIM2.1 context image shows the outlines of the whole
					images for a and c.  The unlabeled 
					outline is that of THEMIS VIS image V03835003 
					(<a href="index.html#V03835003">Fig.&nbsp;16</a>).
