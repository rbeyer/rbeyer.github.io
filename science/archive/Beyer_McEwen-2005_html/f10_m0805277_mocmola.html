<p><span class="textbf">Figure 10:</span>
Portion of MOC image M08/05277 overlain
		with MOLA track 12774, north is to the top.  
		Slopes are locally steepened by the
		presence of the topmost dark layer (indicated by
		an arrow on this image).  Stratigraphically
		lower is a topographic bench.  This bench
		appears to be supported by the next most competent
		sequence of layers (visible on both the
		north and south sides of the massif as indicated
		by the brackets).  Schematic at the bottom gives
		a view from the west, north is to the left, and the
		vertical exaggeration is 2.5.
