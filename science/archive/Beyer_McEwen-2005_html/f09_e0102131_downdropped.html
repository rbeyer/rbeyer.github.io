(a) Portion of MOC image E01/02131 showing a closeup of the 
		westernmost flat-topped area shown in <a href="index.html#context">Fig.&nbsp;5</a>a.  The
		white arrows indicate the topmost strong layer.
		(b)  This schematic illustrates the down-dropped
		block as seen from the west along the A-A' line
		(top profile is the surface, straight lines below
		it represent the dark layer).  It shows that the
		dark layer exposed on the western facing slope has
		a 420&nbsp;m long segment that is about 70&nbsp;m in elevation
		below the level of the majority of the dark layer.
		Distances and elevations derived from MOC and MOLA
		data.
