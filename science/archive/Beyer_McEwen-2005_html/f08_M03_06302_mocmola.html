Portion of MOC image M03/06302, with the
		MOLA data from the track that was acquired
		simultaneously with the image plotted on top.  The
		size of the circles is the approximate size of the
		MOLA footprint (168&nbsp;m diameter).  This image covers
		the crest of the massif, and the white arrows point to
		the outcrops of the topmost competent layer on both sides.
