		The topmost strong layer is interrupted by a crater, but is seen on 
		either side of it on the chasma 
		slope, and may be present within the bowl of the crater
		itself.
		(a) Portion of THEMIS nighttime IR image I07486008.  
					The bowl of the crater is dark and therefore
					has a lower temperature relative to the surrounding 
					terrain.  These temperatures may mean that there is more 
					lower-thermal-inertia dust within the crater than outside.
					However, a bright layer can be seen within the bowl
					of the crater that could correspond to the topmost
					strong layer.
		(b) Portion of THEMIS VIS image V06831002, the black
					boxes show the locations of c and 
					d.
		(c) Portion of MOC image M02/03108.  
					A faint hint of a break in the slope of the crater 75&nbsp;m 
					in elevation below the rim height, the arrows indicate
					this slope break.  Slope break may be the expression
					of the topmost layer in the crater.
		(d) Portion of MOC image M09/04413. The topmost strong
					layer is evident here below a 100&nbsp;m thickness of
					weaker materials.
