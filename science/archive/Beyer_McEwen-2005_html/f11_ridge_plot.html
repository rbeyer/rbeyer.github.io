<p><span class="textbf">Figure 11:</span>
East longitude of the topmost strong layer outcrop
		locations and their elevations both in the massif
		and in the north rim of eastern Coprates Chasma are
		shown.  The elevations of the crest of the massif
		are also plotted to show the variability of the
		massif crest in relation to the layer outcrops.
		The westernmost north rim data point has an arrow
		which points to the estimated elevation of the layer
		in this location prior to the 150&nbsp;m down-dropping
		of this portion of the plateau (see Sections <a href="index.html#west_of_massif">3.4</a>
		and <a href="index.html#tectonic_implications">4.1</a> for details).  The
		error bars on the other two data points result from
		imperfect pointing information which prevents
		accurate MOC/MOLA alignment for these outcrops.
