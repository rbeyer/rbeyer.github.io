		This sketch is a perspective view looking northwest
		at the boundary between Ophir and Aurorae Plana.
		To the left is Coprates Chasma and to the right
		Capri Chasma.  It illustrates the hypothesis
		that the boundary between Ophir and Aurorae Plana
		is due to the eastern limit of the topmost strong
		layer (indicated by arrow, dashed lines give outline of
		buried strong layer).  It also illustrates the
		hypothesis that the next most resistant layers
		(indicated by the brackets) observed 
		below the topmost strong layer along the rim of
		Coprates Chasma is the same as the resistant sequence
		that forms the rim in Capri Chasma.  The strong layers
		displayed below that are schematic.
