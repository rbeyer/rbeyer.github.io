This unit map is simplified from the
		<a href="index.html#Witbeck_VM_Geologic_Map">Witbeck et&nbsp;al. (1991)</a> map, but uses the
		same notation, for more information see
		the original map.  The following units are defined
		on that map: As - Slide material, Hcc - Chasma
		chaotic material, Avfs - Smooth floor material,
		Avfr - Rough floor material, Hpl<sub>3</sub> - Smooth unit,
		Npl<sub>2</sub> - Subdued cratered unit, Hf - Younger
		fractured material, Hr - Ridged plains, HNu -
		Undivided material.  The black line and circle
		denote a fault that was identified by
		<a href="index.html#Witbeck_VM_Geologic_Map">Witbeck et&nbsp;al. (1991)</a> and is discussed
		in this study.  Furthermore, the flat-topped areas
		along the top of the massif are marked as younger
		fractured material (Hf), but this study indicates
		that they are underlain by the same layered stack.
