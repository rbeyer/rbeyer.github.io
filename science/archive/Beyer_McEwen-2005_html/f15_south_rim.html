		Image portions covering the the south rim of Coprates
		Chasma south of the massif.
		(a) M04/02407. No topmost dark, strong layer evident, but the
					plateau surface seems indurated.
		(b) M08/07133.  This image shows that there is a layer that
					has retreated back 80 to 120&nbsp;m from the plateau edge
					(indicated by brackets)
					Based on MOLA elevation data, this layer is 30 to 40&nbsp;m
					thick.
