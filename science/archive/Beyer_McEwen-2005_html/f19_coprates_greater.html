<p><span class="textbf">Figure 19:</span>
The 1/128th degree MOLA gridded data has been stretched to show a 
		restricted elevation range to highlight the variability in the 
		elevation of the plateau surface beyond the north rim of Coprates 
		Chasma.  
		Locations of topmost strong layer outcrops as seen
		in MOC images are noted by round red dots, and the
		two red lines indicate where the layer can be seen
		in THEMIS VIS images.
		The yellow triangles indicate
		those locations noted in <a href="index.html#western_outcrops">Table&nbsp;3</a>
		where a resistant layer is observed, but it is
		uncertain as to whether it is the same dark, competent
		layer noted by the circles.  The orange squares
		indicate the locations of the approximately 70&nbsp;m
		thick unit of resistant layers that cap the Capri
		Chasma edge.
