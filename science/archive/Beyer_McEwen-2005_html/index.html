<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Distinct competent layers are observed in the slopes of eastern
Coprates Chasma, part of the Valles Marineris system on Mars.  Our
observations indicate that the stratigraphy of Coprates Chasma
consists of alternating thin strong layers and thicker sequences
of relatively weak layers.  The strong, competent layers 
maintain steeper slopes and play a major role in controlling the
overall shape and geomorphology of the chasmata slopes.  The topmost
competent layer in this area is well preserved and easy to identify
in outcrops on the northern rim of Coprates Chasma less than 100&nbsp;m 
below the southern Ophir Planum surface.  The volume of the
topmost emplaced layer is at least 70&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> and may be
greater than 2100&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> if the unit underlies most of
Ophir Planum.  The broad extent of this layer allows us to measure
elevation offsets within the north rim of the chasma and in a
freestanding massif within Coprates Chasma where the layer is also
observed.  Rim outcrop morphology and elevation differences between
Ophir and Aurorae Plana may be indicative of the easternmost extent
of the topmost competent layer.  These observations allow an insight
into the depositional processes that formed the stratigraphic stack
into which this portion of the Valles Marineris is carved, and they
present a picture of some of the last volcanic activity in this
area.  Furthermore, the elevation offsets within the layer are
evidence of significant subsidence of the massif and surrounding
material.

<h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<p>
The Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) (<a href="#2001JGR...10623429M">Malin
and Edgett, 2001</a>; <a href="#1992JGR....97.7699M">Malin et&nbsp;al.,
1992</a>) on-board the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft has
observed extensive layering near the martian surface and in the
Valles Marineris system (e.g. <a href="#1999Nature.McEwen">McEwen
et&nbsp;al., 1999</a>; <a href="#2001JGR...10623429M">Malin and
Edgett, 2001</a>).  Layering exposed in the walls of terrestrial
canyons is often sedimentary in nature, with new layers having been
deposited from rivers, lakes, or oceans.  Alternately, volcanic
processes with multiple episodes or pulses of activity can deposit
many layers of volcanic rocks and/or tephra, and intrusive magmatism
can also create layered sequences at depth that are later revealed
by erosion and uplift.  The Valles Marineris is the only feature
that cuts down over 9&nbsp;km into the martian crust.  The origin
of the layers is unknown, but there are hypotheses for both fluvial
sedimentary (e.g. <a href="#2000Sci...290.1927M">Malin and Edgett,
2000</a>) and volcanic
 origins
(e.g. <a href="#1999Nature.McEwen">McEwen et&nbsp;al., 1999</a>;
<a href="#2003GeoRL..30l..25W">Williams et&nbsp;al., 2003</a>).
Even diagenetic processes have been proposed (<a
href="#1995JGR...10026339T">Treiman et&nbsp;al., 1995</a>).  Also
relevant to the exposures that we see today are the formation
processes of the giant chasma system itself (e.g. <a
href="#1991JGR....9622777S">Schultz, 1991</a>; <a
href="#1973JGR....78.4063s">Sharp, 1973</a>; <a
href="#1994JGR....99.3783L">Lucchitta et&nbsp;al., 1994</a>; <a
href="#2001Geomorph.Peulvast">Peulvast et&nbsp;al., 2001</a>; <a
href="#2003JGRE.108e...10M">M&#232;ge et&nbsp;al., 2003</a>; <a
href="#1989LPSC...19..383T">Tanaka and Golombek, 1989</a>; <a
href="#1992mars.book..453L">Lucchitta et&nbsp;al., 1992</a>) and
what geologic changes the region has gone through since these
chasmata opened.
</p>

<p>
Layering can be seen in the high-resolution MOC images, and correlated
with particular heights from individual Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter
(MOLA) (<a href="#2001JGR...10623689S">Smith et&nbsp;al., 2001</a>;
<a href="#1992JGR....97.7781Z">Zuber et&nbsp;al., 1992</a>) tracks.
In addition to the tracks that were acquired simultaneously with
many MOC images, there are a number of MOLA tracks that criss-cross
an area not tied to any particular image.  Thermal  Emission Imaging
System (THEMIS) (<a href="#2004SSRv..110...85C">Christensen
et&nbsp;al., 2004</a>) infrared multi-band images at 100&nbsp;m/pixel
and visible wavelength images at 18&nbsp;m/pixel are useful for
tracing layers, and for constraining their thermo-physical properties
(emissivity and thermal inertia).

<p>
We examined layering seen in the eastern portion of Coprates Chasma
(Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#coprates_location">1</a>, <a
href="#coprates_MOLA">2</a>) and the north rim of Capri Chasma
(<a href="#capri_location">Fig.&nbsp;3</a>).  We estimated individual
layer thickness, measured the thickness of layered units, and
measured the horizontal extent and elevations of layer outcrops.
Layers are identified in several MOC and THEMIS images to determine
how far they extend along the chasmata.  This mapping allows us to
determine if the layers are flat-lying or if they dip down in a
particular direction over large distances.  Lacustrine or deep
oceanic deposits should be horizontal unless they have been
tectonically tilted, in which case the tilted layers should have a
systematic relationship to regional tectonics.  Air-fall ash or
dust will drape over pre-existing topography.  Wind-blown sand will
pile up against topographic obstacles.  Lava flows will be largely
but not entirely horizontal.  Horizontal layers may also be interbedded
lavas, tephra, and sediments.
</p>

<p>
We begin with a brief description of the method we used to obtain
the layer elevations (<a href="#elevation_measure_method">Section&nbsp;2</a>).
We then state the observations that we made of the massif, the
chasmata rims, and chasmata slopes (<a
href="#observations_section">Section&nbsp;3</a>).  Finally, we discuss these
observations (<a href="#discussion_section">Section&nbsp;4</a>) and our
conclusions (<a href="#conclusions">Section&nbsp;5</a>).
</p>


<h2><a name="elevation_measure_method">2 Layer elevation measurement</a></h2>

<p>
Obtaining an accurate measurement for the elevation of an outcrop
of thin (~10&nbsp;m thick) layers with MOLA data cannot be done by
simply reading off the elevation of individual MOLA shots.  MOLA
footprints are 168&nbsp;m in diameter (<a href="#MOLA_CD">Smith
et&nbsp;al., 1999a</a>) and have center-to-center spacings of about
300&nbsp;m.  This means that a MOLA shot, even if it happens to
fall directly on a thin layer is also sampling the elevations above
and below that layer.  However, these layers often sit above constant
slopes with many MOLA shots on it (<a
href="#elevation_measure">Fig.&nbsp;4</a>).  We can get a measurement of the
absolute elevation of the thin layer by using the equation <span
class="math">h = s tan(&theta;)</span>, where <span class="math">h</span>
is the difference in elevation between the elevation of the layer
and the elevation of the center of the MOLA shot just below the
layer, <span class="math">s</span> is the plan form distance between
the center of the MOLA shot just below the layer and the layer
itself, and <span class="math">&theta;</span> is a measurement of
the slope.  This method works even if the orientation of the MOLA
track is not perpendicular to the strike of the layer outcrop as
long as <span class="math">s</span> is measured along the direction
of the MOLA track.
</p>

<p><span class="textbf">Figure 4:</span>
Sketch showing an example cross-section at the
		top of Eastern Coprates Chasma and the way that
		MOLA measurements intersect with the surface.  It

		<a href="f04_elevation_measure.pdf">[Full-size version]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
This measurement estimate breaks down if there is a severe change
in slope just above the highest MOLA shot on the slope.  With the
shot as far down the slope as possible (maximum <span class="math">s</span>
given shot spacing), a ten degree slope difference yields a maximum
error in elevation of about 30&nbsp;m.  This error linearly decreases
with the value of <span class="math">s</span>, which is different
for each measurement.  In practice we think that this error is on
the order of meters for our measurements.
</p>

<p>
When we quote an elevation measurement in this study, it is based
on the MOLA equipotential topography (<a href="#MOLA_CD">Smith
et&nbsp;al., 1999a</a>).  These elevations are the planetary radius
(the distance from the center of Mars to the point on the surface)
minus the areoid radius (the radius of the reference areoid with a
3396&nbsp;km mean equatorial radius).

<h2><a name="observations_section">3 Observations</a></h2>


<h3><a name="massif">3.1 Massif in eastern Coprates Chasma</a></h3>

<p>
A large massif in eastern Coprates Chasma is situated closer to the
north wall of Coprates Chasma than the southern wall, near where
the Valles Marineris widens into Capri Chasma (Figs.&nbsp;<a
href="#coprates_location">1</a> and <a href="#coprates_MOLA">2</a>).
It is located near 15&deg;&nbsp;S, between 304&deg; and 307&deg;&nbsp;E.
MOC images display spur-and-gully morphology and layers on the
massif that are very similar to the chasma wall rock.  The massif
appears to be compositionally and structurally similar to the chasma
wall rock as well (<a href="#1979JGR....84.1009F">Frey, 1979</a>;
<a href="#1991JGR....9622777S">Schultz, 1991</a>).  This massif has
a few flat-topped areas along its roughly 230&nbsp;km length
(<a href="#context">Fig.&nbsp;5</a>).  The flat-topped areas along
the spine of the massif are most likely the remnants of the plains
surface that covered this area prior to the opening of Coprates
Chasma.

</p>
</div>

<p>
Just below the level of those flat-topped areas on the massif and
in other places along the crest of the massif, a distinct, dark-toned
layer can be seen (<a href="#context">Fig.&nbsp;5</a>a), even in
sunward facing slopes (<a href="#sunward_facing">Fig.&nbsp;6</a>).
<a href="#layer_example">Figure&nbsp;7</a> shows higher resolution
images highlighting this resistant cliff-forming unit which crops
out below the flat-topped surfaces.  Since this layer can be seen
everywhere along the edge in <a href="#sunward_facing">Fig.&nbsp;6</a>,
and a layer with a similar expression and morphology is observed
22&nbsp;km farther east (<a href="#layer_example">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>),
we think that it may be extensive.  In fact, there are several MOC
images along the massif where a layer with very similar characteristics
is exposed (<a href="#outcrops">Table&nbsp;1</a>).

The elevation measurements of this topmost strong layer (<a
href="#outcrops">Table&nbsp;1</a>) allow us to estimate the apparent dip of
this layer.  We assume that the layer was originally horizontal
(see <a href="#tectonic_implications">Section&nbsp;4.1</a> for why we
think that this is a reasonable assumption).  We can measure apparent
dips in two general directions (<a href="#layer_dip">Table&nbsp;2</a>).
The massif is oriented roughly east-west, with its general trend
about 10&deg; north of west, and we have several measurements of
the layer outcrop along it.  In a few places the layer is exposed
on both the north and south faces of the massif, allowing us to
measure a few apparent dips in a more north-south direction
(<a href="#M03_06302">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>).

An example of north-south extension can be seen on the westernmost
flat-topped area of the massif.  MOC image E01/02131 (<a

a hundred meters below the flat-topped level of the massif, and a
420&nbsp;m long segment that dropped about 70&nbsp;m. This measurement
is based on extrapolations of the elevations of the topmost strong
layer in this area.  Given the length of the segment, the width of
the gap in the layer above, and the 70&nbsp;m of down-drop, we find
that the normal faults which bound this down-dropped block have
fault angles of 60&deg;, consistent with normal faults on the Earth.
The layer isn't the only thing showing that there is a down-dropped
block here, MOC and MOLA data also show a shallow depression
(60&nbsp;m deep above the down-dropped layer exposure) which probably
indicates the extent of this block.  Unfortunately, there are no
MOC images to help determine the eastern extent of this block.

<p>
The topmost strong layer is the most easily identifiable layer in
the stack due to its visual contrast and high apparent strength.
However, other resistant layers can be identified below it.  The
next lower exposure of competent layers is part of a sequence at
least 200&nbsp;m thick.  It is difficult to determine if this
sequence is varying in thickness from place to place or if it is
partially buried by talus.  This sequence also contributes to the
steep slopes near the crest of the massif and supports a topographic
bench in MOC image M08/05277 (<a href="#M08_05277">Fig.&nbsp;10</a>).
Unlike the distinct topmost layer, this unit appears to be a sequence
of more resistant layers, and while not as dark as the topmost
competent layer, it does have a slightly darker tone than surrounding
weak layers.

<p>
The western exposures of this topmost layer and next most competent
unit appear to have a 100&nbsp;m thick sequence of slightly
lighter-toned thinly bedded materials between them.  However,
M03/06302 and M00/02438 (in the eastern part of the massif) do not
show such a gap between these two units.  The gap between these
units is identified by slope morphology and a slight change in tone
between the intervening weak layer and the next competent unit.  To
determine whether these strata represent thinning and thickening
units, a true unconformity, or if we are not correctly interpreting
these exposures will require more coverage.
</p>

<p>
Other competent layers are seen farther down the stratigraphic stack
but are more difficult to discern due to the amounts of talus that
mantle the slopes.  These lower competent units are evident in
occasional spurs or ridges that crop out from the talus mantle on
the slopes.  However, it is difficult to correlate these layers
along the chasma slopes because they are not seen everywhere at a
particular elevation due to the spur-and-gully morphology of the
slopes, and the differential accumulation of talus at different
locales.

<h3><a name="north_of_massif">3.2 Coprates Chasma slope, north of massif</a></h3>

<p>
The topmost strong layer observed in the massif is also evident
directly north of the massif in the north rim of Coprates Chasma
(see <a href="#outcrops">Table&nbsp;1</a>).  Unfortunately, due to
small pointing errors in the MOLA dataset, only two of these four
MOC images can be precisely aligned with their MOLA tracks.  The
two good outcrops yield a 0.04&deg; slope down to the
west (<a href="#layer_dip">Table&nbsp;2</a>).  Our estimates for
the elevations of the other outcrops are consistent with this slope
as well.  These measurements indicate that the topmost strong layer
in the north rim of Coprates Chasma is flat-lying relative to the
layer in the massif.  The outcrop elevations here are higher than
in the massif (<a href="#ridgeplot">Fig.&nbsp;11</a>).

The next unit of strong layers seen to crop out below the topmost
strong layer in the massif is also evident here on the north rim
of Coprates Chasma (<a href="#E03_02145">Fig.&nbsp;12</a>), where
it is not obscured by talus on the slope.  Again, it appears to be
100 to 200&nbsp;m thick, but seems to be about 200&nbsp;m
stratigraphically below the topmost strong layer.

<p>
The topmost strong layer is modified by a 7.5&nbsp;km diameter
crater perched near the edge of the plateau that is sectioned by
the chasma (<a href="#sectioned_crater">Fig.&nbsp;13</a>).  The
layer is observed in the chasma rim to the east and west of the
crater.  Therefore the bowl of the crater should intersect the
layer, however it is not immediately apparent.  A thin, bright layer
can be seen in the nighttime THEMIS data (<a
href="#sectioned_crater">Fig.&nbsp;13</a>a) in approximately the expected
location within the crater.  Arrows in <a
href="#sectioned_crater">Fig.&nbsp;13</a>c point out an apparent break in
slope on the crater wall.  This break in slope is 75&nbsp;m in
elevation below the rim of the crater, but 130&nbsp;m above the
elevation of the topmost competent layer as observed in M09/04413
(<a href="#sectioned_crater">Fig.&nbsp;13</a>d).  The rim of the
crater is about 100&nbsp;m above the surrounding plateau.  If that
is how much the stratigraphy here has been uplifted because of the
impact, then this break in slope may indeed be the topmost competent
layer uplifted by the impact.

<h3>3.3 Coprates Chasma slope, south of massif</h3>

<p>
The rim of Coprates Chasma directly south of the massif has a very
different character from that directly to the north of the massif
and the slopes of the massif itself.  <a
href="#1991JGR....9622777S">Schultz (1991)</a> noted a structural
difference between the north and south slopes of Coprates Chasma
in general.  There is also a difference between the the southern
rim and slope of this easternmost section of Coprates Chasma from
that farther west.  The plateau beyond the south rim here is just
east of the Coprates rise (<a href="#coprates_MOLA">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>)
into which are carved the Nectaris Fossae farther south.  This broad
anticline separates the higher Thaumasia Planum to the west from
the lower-lying Noachis Terra to the south and east of Valles
Marineris.  Therefore the character of the greater plateau geography
south of the rim here is different than that farther west towards
Tharsis.
</p>


<p>
The differences between the north and south rims of Coprates Chasma
are highlighted by high-resolution images and topography.  MOLA
data indicate that the range of surface slopes is similar on the
slopes of Coprates Chasma both north and south of the massif, as
well as on the massif itself (<a href="#slopes">Fig.&nbsp;14</a>).
The trend of the chasma's rim to the south is more irregular and
scalloped by large landslide alcoves than on the north rim of the
chasma in this region.  Along the northern slope, the ridges in the
spur-and-gully morphology have a roughly regular wavelength from
1.5 to 5&nbsp;km.  The south slope displays two characters: to the
west, it is dominated by large landslide alcoves, whose bounding
spurs have a wavelength from 5.5 to 6.5&nbsp;km; to the east, the
slopes are not dominated by landslide alcoves, and show a more
regular spur-and-gully morphology with a spur wavelength similar
to that of the north slope.

<p>
These gross differences in slope morphology are not the only
differences between the east and west portions of the slope of
Coprates Chasma south of the massif.  The elevation of the plateau
along the north rim of Coprates Chasma maintains a relatively
constant elevation along the 230&nbsp;km length of the massif.
However, the plateau along the south rim varies from 600&nbsp;m
below the elevation of the north rim in the west to nearly the same
elevation as the north rim in the east (<a
href="#coprates_MOLA">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>).
</p>

<p>
Although portions of the southern plateau edge have higher elevations
than the summit of the massif, no evidence of the topmost dark
competent layer can be seen along its length.  Here, the rim does
not show cliff-forming layers although such sequences are observed
farther down-section (<a href="#south_rim">Fig.&nbsp;15</a>).

<p>
The MOC coverage along the south rim is quite sparse, and so there
may be an observational bias, but there are only occasional outcrops
of competent units below the plateau surface along the slopes, and
we cannot correlate them to other outcrops along the south slope,
nor to those within the massif or north slope.

<p>
Farther west a promontory near 303&deg;&nbsp;E, 13.5&deg;&nbsp;S
juts south into the chasma (<a href="#promontory">Fig.&nbsp;17</a>).
The plateau surface of this promontory shows east-west linear
depressions, and a slight drop in elevation, which led <a
href="#Witbeck_VM_Geologic_Map">Witbeck et&nbsp;al. (1991)</a> to
mark a normal fault in this area.  MOC image E03/01374 (<a
href="#promontory">Fig.&nbsp;17</a>c) shows the topmost layer cropping out
here.  In this area instead of an even stack of material above the
strong layer, there are hills or hummocks from 500&nbsp;m to 1&nbsp;km
in diameter.  The elevation of the topmost strong layer here is
2106&nbsp;m, 167&nbsp;m lower than the elevation 45&nbsp;km to the
east.  MOLA data show that the plateau surface at the south edge
of the promontory is about 150&nbsp;m lower than the plateau surface
north of the fault zone.  If the layer here was down-dropped a
similar amount, then the pre-fault elevation of the layer here is
consistent with the elevation of the layer in the chasma slope north
of the massif (<a href="#ridgeplot">Fig.&nbsp;11</a>).  In addition
to being evidence of the extent of the layer, this outcrop also
displays how normal faulting has modified the layer.
</p>

<p>
Farther west from the immediate area of the massif, coverage
decreases, and identification of the topmost strong layer becomes
more difficult.  MOC image E02/01171 (<a
href="#E02_01171">Fig.&nbsp;18</a>) displays a resistant layer, but the
material above it has retreated back from the edge by 100 to
200&nbsp;m (MOLA indicates that the thickness of that layer is only
10&nbsp;m).  The elevation of the resistant layer is 2787&nbsp;m,
roughly 500&nbsp;m above the elevations of the topmost resistant
layer north of the massif.  MOC images farther west along the
Coprates Chasma north rim also show a resistant layer just below
the plateau surface. If it is all the same layer, its elevation
mimics that of the plateau surface (the layer is observed either
at the elevation of the plateau surface or tens of meters below it)
as it rises up above 5000&nbsp;m and then descends back down where
Coprates Chasma meets Melas Chasma to the west (<a

<p>
It is difficult to tell if these outcrops of resistant rocks that
form a distinct break in slope between the plateau surfaces and the
slopes are all part of the same topmost resistant strong layer
observed north of the massif in eastern Coprates Chasma.  The
high-resolution coverage is sparse, which makes lateral continuity
of the layers difficult to establish.
</p>

<p>

positively identify it in MOC and THEMIS VIS images in eastern

<h3>3.5 Capri Chasma slope</h3>

<p>
Where <a href="#Witbeck_VM_Geologic_Map">Witbeck et&nbsp;al.

 units, roughly coinciding with the boundary between
Ophir Planum and Aurorae Planum (Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#coprates_MOLA">2</a>
and <a href="#coprates_geomap">20</a>), we note an additional
elevation difference between the two plana and a difference in
chasma rim morphology.  North of the massif in Coprates Chasma,
that rim is marked by the presence of the topmost competent layer
supporting a stack of presumably weaker overburden materials that
form the edge of the plateau.  East of this Ophir/Aurorae boundary,
where the MOC images show a sharp edge, that rim appears to consist
of a stack of resistant layers, rather than showing a distinct,
single layer.  The elevations of the top of this stack are consistently
200-300&nbsp;m below the elevation of the topmost competent layer
north of the massif in Coprates Chasma.  An example of this is in
E05/02164 (<a href="#E05_02164">Fig.&nbsp;21</a>).

A small tributary chasma (<a href="#capri_sidechasm">Fig.&nbsp;22</a>)
cuts into the side of Capri Chasma (<a
href="#capri_location">Fig.&nbsp;3</a>) near 308&deg;&nbsp;E, 13&deg;&nbsp;S,
and displays more of its stratigraphy.  M02/03555 (<a
href="#M02_03555">Fig.&nbsp;23</a>) shows a detail of the north rim of this
tributary chasma cutting into the plateau surface (which is at
1820&nbsp;m).  A unit of cliff-forming layers can be seen on the
north rim of the tributary chasma, and the corner where a short,
theater-headed depression intersects the tributary chasma.  However,
the expression of this unit disappears northward along the eastern
rim of that shallow depression.  The depression's depth appears to
be limited by a unit that crops out from 1050&nbsp;m to 700&nbsp;m
elevation in the tributary chasma. The morphology of the depression
indicates that it was perhaps a channel formed by sapping into the
massive layer.  If so, this would indicate that perhaps that unit
is not only relatively stronger, but also potentially an aquitard.
Just slightly farther east, M09/04970 (<a
href="#M09_04970">Fig.&nbsp;24</a>) also covers the north rim of the tributary
chasma, showing a competent unit around 1750&nbsp;m elevation.

More evidence of a uniform stratigraphy beneath Aurorae Planum can
be seen farther northeast along the Capri Chasma rim. E09/02363 and
M08/05759 show a stack of resistant layers that form the chasma
rim, then a massive unit, and another resistant unit from 800 to
500&nbsp;m elevation.  M07/01362 (<a href="#M07_01362">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>)
shows a strong cliff edge, and a possible dust cover on the plateau
that appears to have receded back revealing a more rocky surface
which appears to be the top of a layered stack 70&nbsp;m thick, a
massive section (possibly talus covered), and then resistant layering
from 880 to 640&nbsp;m elevation.  Even farther northeast, M11/01959
also displays a distinct resistant layered stack, 70&nbsp;m thick,
that forms the chasma rim.  This image also shows a massive section
(possibly talus covered) and then a resistant layered unit from
1040 to 840&nbsp;m in elevation.

The expression of a &ge;70&nbsp;m thick unit of cliff-forming layers
at the chasma rim followed below by a massive unit or talus covering,
and then a resistant unit of 200 to 300&nbsp;m thickness is observed
along a 250&nbsp;km stretch of Capri Chasma.  These observations
indicate a relatively consistent stratigraphy over a large distance
and may also be indicative of the stratigraphy that underlies the
entire Aurorae Planum.  The elevation of the top of that 70&nbsp;m
thick unit varies by 200&nbsp;m along that distance, but is still
relatively flat-lying.  Similarly, the outcrops of the resistant
layer within the slope vary, but are also relatively flat-lying.
</p>


<h3>3.6 Thickness and extent of the topmost strong layer</h3>

<p>
We were unable to make a direct measurement with MOLA data of the
thickness of the topmost layer in Coprates Chasma. However, based
on elevation and slope information from the various outcrop locations
and plan form extents in narrow angle MOC images, we estimate that
its thickness is about 10&nbsp;m.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#Witbeck_VM_Geologic_Map">Witbeck et&nbsp;al. (1991)</a>
interpreted both the the flat-topped areas along the spine of the
massif and the plateau at the north rim as early Hesperian lava
flows but mapped them differently based on their structural
modification (normal faults on the massif, wrinkle ridges on the
plateau, <a href="#coprates_geomap">Fig.&nbsp;20</a>).  Our
observations indicate that both terrains are underlain by the same
sequence of layers.
</p>

<p>
Our MOC and THEMIS VIS surveys of Coprates Chasma indicate that the
topmost competent dark layer seen in the massif is also positively
identified in the rim of Coprates Chasma directly north of the
massif (<a href="#coprates_greater">Fig.&nbsp;19</a>).  If we draw
a simple polygon connecting these outcrops, we estimate a
8700&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> areal extent.  This estimate does not take
into account the unknown amount of north-south extension between
the north slope and the massif.  If we assume 60&deg; fault surfaces,
and that the floor of Coprates Chasma between the massif and the
north wall was the former plateau surface, we can estimate that
extension at about 7&nbsp;km (the estimate rises to 8&nbsp;km if
the graben block is buried by a kilometer of fill).  If we take
this estimate of extension into account, then the area is only about
7000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.  However, both of these estimates assume
that the layer terminates just inside the north wall, and doesn't
account for how extensive the layer might have been before creation
of the chasma.  Due to this uncertainty, the true areal extent of
this layer is likely to be greater than these values.
</p>


<h2><a name="discussion_section">4 Discussion</a></h2>

<p>
We hypothesize that the stratigraphy exposed along the north rim
of this section of eastern Coprates Chasma, along the edges of the
massif, and along the rim of Capri Chasma are all a part of the
same extensive stratigraphic stack present in this region.  At many
locations we observe a single, approximately 10&nbsp;m thick,
dark-toned, competent layer that appears to act as a resistant cap
just below the break in slope between plateau surfaces and chasma
slopes (<a href="#outcrops">Table&nbsp;1</a>, <a
href="#coprates_greater">Fig.&nbsp;19</a>).  Below that layer, there are a
few hundred meters of lighter-toned, finely layered material that
appears less competent.  Below that we see a sequence of darker-toned
competent layers, about 100&nbsp;m thick.  Since this pattern is
seen along the north rim of eastern Coprates Chasma, along the edge
of the flat-topped areas of the massif, and to a lesser extent along
the rim of Capri Chasma, we think that we are observing different
portions of an extensive set of layers.
</p>

<p>
Using Viking Orbiter data, <a href="#1995JGR...10026339T">Treiman
et&nbsp;al. (1995)</a> identified a layering packet 400&nbsp;m thick
that they thought was ubiquitous throughout Valles Marineris. It
was present at the chasmata rims with a similar thickness regardless
of plateau elevation.  From this data, they interpreted the layering
to be the result of diagenetic processes.  Although our study does
not include all of the chasmata rims examined by <a
href="#1995JGR...10026339T">Treiman et&nbsp;al. (1995)</a>, we can
comment on those in eastern Coprates and Capri Chasmata.  The topmost
strong layer that we observe directly contradicts many of the
arguments that study makes for diagenesis.  We find that where the
layer intersects a large crater, it is modified by the impact
(<a href="#north_of_massif">Section&nbsp;3.2</a> and <a
href="#sectioned_crater">Fig.&nbsp;13</a>), indicating that it was present
prior to that impact.  We find this layer to be at different depths
below the plateau surface in different places.  We do not find
evidence of the topmost strong layer along the Capri Chasma rim,
indicating the extent of this particular layer, furthermore we find
differences between the north and south rims of eastern Coprates
Chasma.  Therefore, we find no evidence for the structural and
stratigraphic &ldquo;transgressions&rdquo; indicated by <a
href="#1995JGR...10026339T">Treiman et&nbsp;al. (1995)</a>, nor do
we think that a diagenetic origin is likely for the layers observed
along the rims of these chasmata.
</p>

<p>
Given the dark tone and relatively high strength of the few competent
layers or competent layered units, we think that their most likely
composition is that of a relatively dense basalt.  The topmost
competent layer exhibits a morphology and extent that is comparable
to terrestrial flood basalts and inflated sheet flows (e.g. <a
href="#2000JGR...10515027K">Keszthelyi et&nbsp;al., 2000</a>; <a
href="#1998JGR...10327447K">Keszthelyi and Self, 1998</a>; <a
href="#1998JGR...10327411T">Thordarson and Self, 1998</a>).  The
presence of flood lavas on Mars has been suspected for some time
(e.g. <a href="#1999Nature.McEwen">McEwen et&nbsp;al., 1999</a>;
<a href="#2000JGR...10515027K">Keszthelyi et&nbsp;al., 2000</a>;
<a href="#1992mars.book..424M">Mouginis-Mark et&nbsp;al., 1992</a>;
<a href="#1981RvGSP..19...13G">Greeley and Spudis, 1981</a>), and
suggested recently by <a href="#2003LPI....34.1539O">Ori and Karna
(2003)</a>.  The other competent layers farther down the stack are
more difficult to characterize, and may be sequences of thin flows
interbedded with tephra or other sediments.  A basaltic composition
for Valles Marineris in general is indicated by Phobos ISM (<a
href="#2000Icar..147..444M">Murchie et&nbsp;al., 2000</a>), TES (<a
href="#2000Sci...287.1626B">Bandfield et&nbsp;al., 2000</a>), and
THEMIS (<a href="#2003LPI....34.1519C">Christensen et&nbsp;al.,
2003a</a>) measurements although specific layers are not resolved.
Given the footprint sizes of these instruments (22&nbsp;km/pixel
for Phobos ISM, 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;9&nbsp;km pixels for TES, and
100&nbsp;m/pixel for THEMIS), they are probably sampling the
intervening weak layers and talus to a large extent, although the
strong layers could have stronger absorption bands, dominating the
signal.  The relatively weak layers (either volcanic tephra or
sediments derived from competent volcanic material) are probably
not thick competent lava flows, but could have a basaltic composition.
It is expected that there is a much greater ratio of tephra to lava
on Mars than on Earth (<a href="#1994RvGeo..32..221W">Wilson and
Head, 1994</a>).  However, given the overall strength of the slopes
(<a href="#2002GeoRL..29s..38S">Schultz, 2002</a>), the intervening
relatively weak sequences are probably lithified, but not as strong
as the thin dark-toned sequences.
</p>

<h3><a name="tectonic_implications">4.1 Tectonic implications</a></h3>

<p>
In order to interpret our measurements of the topmost strong layer,
we must make some assumptions about its original position.  The
topmost strong layer was either emplaced horizontally and subsequently
altered by tectonic forces into the exposures that we measure today,
or it was emplaced over an undulatory pre-existing surface, and the
elevations where we observe it are the original locations of these
outcrops, or a combination of these two.  Based on the data that
are available to us, we cannot truly determine which of these
scenarios occurred, but there is some evidence that leads us to
think that the layer was emplaced horizontally (for the most part),
and the offsets observed within the massif are due to tectonic
activity.
</p>

<p>
The apparent dips measured between the outcrops within the massif
and the north rim are all quite low (<a
href="#layer_dip">Table&nbsp;2</a>), the largest being 3.65&deg; dipping down
to the south within the massif.  <a href="#1998JGR...10327447K">Keszthelyi
and Self (1998)</a> indicate that long lava flows on the Earth can
occur on slopes up to about 5&deg;, and that the effect of reduced
gravity would allow long lava flows on steeper slopes.  So these
slopes on their own, do not suggest tectonic movement.
</p>

<p>
In most locations where the next most competent sequence is observed,
it has a consistent elevation difference with the topmost strong
layer.  Again, this by itself might only argue that the next most
competent sequence was laid down on an undulatory surface, making
its surface undulatory, and the overlying strata (topmost strong
layer included) simply conformed to this surface.
</p>

<p>
However, all of these data together, combined with the observations
of the down-dropped block (<a href="#massif">Section&nbsp;3.1</a> and
<a href="#E01_02131_downdropped">Fig.&nbsp;9</a>) and the down-dropped
promontory surface (<a href="#west_of_massif">Section&nbsp;3.4</a> and
<a href="#promontory">Fig.&nbsp;17</a>) lead us to the conclusion
that the topmost strong layer was emplaced mostly horizontally.
Therefore, the variety of elevations at which the topmost strong
layer is observed are the result of tectonic movements, not just
original emplacement at a variety of elevations.  Additionally,
this supports the theory that eastern Coprates Chasma underwent
some north-south extensional motion and subsidence (<a
href="#1991JGR....9622777S">Schultz, 1991</a>; <a
href="#1998PSS...46..827S">Schultz, 1998</a>; <a
href="#2005Icar..175...68F">Fueten et&nbsp;al., 2005</a>; <a
href="#1997JGR...10212009S">Schultz, 1997</a>; <a
href="#2001Geomorph.Peulvast">Peulvast et&nbsp;al., 2001</a>; <a
href="#1992mars.book..453L">Lucchitta et&nbsp;al., 1992</a>) and
the massif here is a horst block.
</p>

<p>
In addition to this large scale horst and graben structure, this
portion of Coprates Chasma displays a kind of blunt-canyon morphology
in the rim to the northwest of the massif, and there is a short
north-south oriented re-entrant cut into the slope there (<a
href="#V03835003">Fig.&nbsp;16</a>).  That might be the remnant of a cross-fault
(<a href="#2003JGRE.108f...10W">Wilkins and Schultz, 2003</a>) that
demarcated the western extent of the massif block.
</p>

<p>
The massif block subsided on the order of a hundred meters (over
350&nbsp;m at the west end and 150&nbsp;m at the east end), and it
must have tilted down slightly to the west either during chasma
formation or in the time since.  We find two different measures of
the north-south apparent dip of the topmost strong layer in the
massif, so there must also be faults within the massif that are
responsible for the apparent dip angle difference and allowed for
a twisting motion within the massif.  Additionally, the promontory
to the west indicates subsidence on the south side of the graben
identified there by <a href="#Witbeck_VM_Geologic_Map">Witbeck
et&nbsp;al. (1991)</a> of about 150&nbsp;m.
</p>

<p>
While the apparent dip angles in the massif layer display a greater
east-west tilt than the relatively flat-lying layer in the north
slope, the measurements of the topmost layer outcrops there display
a faint apparent dip down towards the west (<a
href="#layer_dip">Table&nbsp;2</a>).  These measurements are consistent with
the gradient of 0.03&deg; found by <a href="#1999Sci...284.1495S">Smith
et&nbsp;al. (1999b)</a> in the floor of Coprates Chasma east of
about 300&deg;&nbsp;E longitude.  This similarity indicates that
the gradient of the chasma floor may not be independent of the
chasma slope rock strata in this region.
</p>

<p>
A qualitative observation can be made that the rim of Coprates
Chasma directly north of the massif has a mostly linear trend,
however farther westwards, the northern slope of Coprates Chasma
contains more arcuate landslide alcoves, as do portions of the slope
south of the massif.  We hypothesize that the infrequent strong
layers are contributing to both of these morphologic characters.
These sequences of more resistant rock may be acting to provide
structural support, and therefore their presence or absence is an
important factor in the overall morphology of the slope.  Thickness
of individual resistant sequences, vertical density of such sequences,
and even fault patterns within those sequences may be governing
whether a particular stretch of chasma rim has a mostly linear trend
with small spur-and-gully morphology or whether the rim is susceptible
to large landslides.  As slopes are eroded, the presence of resistant
layers will provide structure and may help to maintain broad linear
trends.  However, these layers will also cause locally steepened
slopes below them, eventually making these areas more susceptible
to catastrophic failure, perhaps triggered by a seismic event (<a
href="#2002GeoRL..29s..38S">Schultz, 2002</a>).
</p>

<h3>4.2 Boulders and blocks</h3>

<p>
<a href="#2001JGR...10623429M">Malin and Edgett (2001)</a> note
that there are few boulders observed at the bases of the slopes
within Valles Marineris. They infer that particles derived from
wall materials do not have sufficient strength to maintain large
sizes during their descent to the base of the slope.  <a
href="#2000Sci...290.1927M">Malin and Edgett (2000)</a> indicate
that where steep scarps occur in obviously volcanic terrain, boulders
are often seen downslope.
</p>

<p>
In order to gain an understanding of the competency and strength
of eroding units, we surveyed all MOC images with resolutions better
than 4&nbsp;m/pixel (up to 1.41&nbsp;m/pixel) in the eastern Coprates
Chasma region to look for boulders and blocks.  Objects must be at
least two pixels in diameter to be observed under the best conditions.
Objects would have to be many more pixels in diameter if the
photometric conditions were less than perfect, or if the objects
were largely buried.  Given these size parameters we are looking
for objects that fall into the very coarse boulder to coarse block
categories of <a href="#Blair_1999sed">Blair and McPherson (1999)</a>.
We will refer to all of the objects in this size range as blocks
for simplicity.
</p>

<p>
We observed blocks in some images, at a host of different elevations
on the slopes, but none on the flat floor of Coprates Chasma or
near the base of the slopes.  In all cases where we did observe
blocks, it was clear that these blocks had been shed from strong
layers immediately upslope of their locations (<a
href="#boulders">Fig.&nbsp;26</a>).  We conclude that the strong layers here
produce blocks of similar sizes as seen elsewhere on Mars, but that
they either do not roll farther than about 1&nbsp;km or do not
survive transport over more than about 1&nbsp;km.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Perhaps as the strong layers within the slope are broken up by the
landslide process, the resultant particles either ride the surface
of the landslide or are displaced upward from within.  Either way,
the blocks would suffer less damage than they would otherwise
experience if they were to roll and fall down the entire slope (as
suggested by <a href="#2001JGR...10623429M">Malin and Edgett,
2001</a>).  This scenario would explain why boulders and blocks are
seen on landslide deposits on the Valles Marineris floor (<a
href="#2001JGR...10623429M">Malin and Edgett, 2001</a>), but not
on the floor materials in general.
</p>

<h3>4.3 Wrinkle ridges and extent of the topmost strong layer</h3>

<p>
Wrinkle ridges are observed on Ophir Planum (<a
href="#2004AREPS..32..435M">Mueller and Golombek, 2004</a>; <a
href="#1990JGR....9514215Z">Zuber and Aist, 1990</a>; <a
href="#1993JGR....9817049W">Watters, 1993</a>; <a
href="#1991JGR....9615599W">Watters, 1991</a>).  The recent
quantitative model by <a href="#2000JGR...10512035S">Schultz
(2000)</a> indicates that wrinkle ridges are formed when a blind
thrust fault occurs below layers which are capable of bedding plane
slip, have large strength contrasts, or both.  This stratigraphic
situation is exactly what we observe along the north rim of Coprates
Chasma.  In fact, the topmost competent layer is only observed where
the ridged plains unit is cut by slopes (Figures&nbsp;<a
href="#coprates_greater">19</a> and <a href="#coprates_geomap">20</a>).
If blind thrust faults occur at depth below the planum surface,
then bedding plane slip might occur between the layers of different
strength that we observe in the stratigraphic stack here.  This
slip could result in those layers forming a wrinkle ridge in the
plateau surface material, as is observed across Ophir Planum.  The
observation of wrinkle ridges on Ophir Planum may be an indication
that there is a uniformity of strata that underlies Ophir Planum,
and more specifically we hypothesize that the topmost strong layer
may underlie Ophir Planum.
</p>

<p>
Since wrinkle ridges and the ridged plains unit extend westwards
on Ophir Planum from eastern Coprates Chasma, this may strengthen
the interpretation that competent layers observed farther west
(<a href="#coprates_greater">Fig.&nbsp;19</a>) are part of the same
stratigraphic stack that we observe near the massif.  However,
whether it underlies the smooth unit (Hpl<sub>3</sub>) and the
younger fractured material (Hf) (<a href="#Witbeck_VM_Geologic_Map">Witbeck
et&nbsp;al., 1991</a>) of Ophir Planum west of 298&deg;&nbsp;E is
unknown.  <a href="#1991JGR....9622777S">Schultz (1991)</a> suggests
that the ridged plains may underlie this area, with the wrinkle
ridges buried beneath several hundred meters of material, but it
is clear that he thinks it unlikely.  It is possible that the same
unit underlies both terrains, and that different tectonic forces,
or different stratigraphies at depth are affecting its surface
expression in different ways.
</p>

<p>
If the topmost strong layer is an extensive and continuous lava
flow, there are only two ways for it to achieve the anticlinal shape
indicated by the MOLA data (<a href="#coprates_greater">Fig.&nbsp;19</a>).
One way is for the source vent for this sheet to be somewhere on
the local elevation maxima, in which case this last volcanic flow
would have occurred after the broad topography formed.  Alternately,
this sheet could have been emplaced mostly horizontally prior to
crustal flexure in this area (<a href="#1994JGR....99.8371S">Schultz
and Tanaka, 1994</a>; <a href="#1996PSS...44.1471M">M&#232;ge
and Masson, 1996</a>; <a href="#1992mars.book..249B">Banerdt
et&nbsp;al., 1992</a>), and then folded into an anticline.  However
this theory is speculative, as we cannot determine if the resistant
layer observed in western Coprates Chasma along the north rim is
the same topmost strong layer observed near the massif in the east.
A greater amount of high-resolution coverage would be required along
the chasma rim to make this correlation.
</p>

<h3>4.4 Depositional implications</h3>

<p>
Coupling our conservative areal estimate of the topmost strong layer
(7000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) with our estimated 10&nbsp;m thickness
yields a 70&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> volume estimate.  If the material
is a single lava flow, then this minimum volume of lava is similar
to the smaller volume flood lava flow fields within the Columbia
River Basalts on Earth (e.g. <a href="#VTCRB.Reidel">Reidel
et&nbsp;al., 1989</a>; <a href="#1998JGR...10327447K">Keszthelyi
and Self, 1998</a>; <a href="#VTCRB.Tolan">Tolan et&nbsp;al.,
1989</a>).  For example, the Roza flow is 1300&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>
(<a href="#1998JGR...10327447K">Keszthelyi and Self, 1998</a>).
Our thickness estimate for this Martian flow is also within terrestrial
norms. <a href="#VTCRB.Reidel">Reidel et&nbsp;al. (1989)</a> indicate
that flows range in thickness from a few meters to about one hundred
meters, averaging 30&nbsp;m.  These values are also within the range
of lava flows measured on Mars (<a
href="#flow_comparison_table">Table&nbsp;4</a>).

</p>
</div>

<p>
If we assume that this topmost strong layer underlies a sizable
portion of the <a href="#Witbeck_VM_Geologic_Map">Witbeck et&nbsp;al.
(1991)</a> ridged plains (Hr) unit in Ophir Planum, then the volume
estimate rises to over 2100&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>.  Although it is a
large volume, it is still near the largest volume for a single
terrestrial flood lava flow (<a href="#VTCRB.Reidel">Reidel
et&nbsp;al., 1989</a>; <a href="#1998JGR...10327447K">Keszthelyi
and Self, 1998</a>; <a href="#VTCRB.Tolan">Tolan et&nbsp;al.,
1989</a>), and still within reasonable values for measured martian
flows.
</p>

<p>
The hypothesis that the topmost strong layer underlies, and is in
fact partially responsible for the ridged plains of Ophir Planum
has implications for the boundary between Ophir Planum and Aurorae
Planum.  As mentioned above, a morphological change across this
boundary exists as noted by <a href="#Witbeck_VM_Geologic_Map">Witbeck
et&nbsp;al. (1991)</a>, and the two plana have a subtle elevation
difference of a few hundred meters from Ophir to Aurorae.  Finally,
the topmost strong layer is not observed at the Capri Chasma rim.
We hypothesize that the boundary between Ophir and Aurorae Plana
is the easternmost extent of the volcanic layer that we have been
identifying as the topmost strong layer which crops out in Coprates
Chasma.
</p>

<p>
The stack of resistant layers that marks the Capri Chasma rim may
be the next sequence of resistant layers that is observed
stratigraphically below the topmost strong layer in eastern Coprates
Chasma in both massif and north rim outcrops (e.g. <a
href="#ophir_aurorae_cartoon">Fig.&nbsp;27</a>).  The difference in elevation
between Ophir Planum and Aurorae Planum could be because the topmost
strong layer is not present, and the less resistant material observed
between the topmost layer and the next resistant sequence has been
eroded away (or was never there), such that the top of that resistant
sequence forms the basement for the Aurorae Planum surface.  This
would indicate that Aurorae Planum must be older than Ophir Planum,
although both are Hesperian in age.  This age difference is supported
by crater-count data in Table&nbsp;1 of <a
href="#Witbeck_VM_Geologic_Map">Witbeck et&nbsp;al. (1991)</a>.  As
observed along both Coprates and Capri Chasmata most outcrops of
the topmost resistant layer show a mantle up to 100&nbsp;m thick.
This mantling material covers the surfaces of both Ophir and Aurorae
Plana, smoothing the surficial transition between the two.

</div>

<p>
Depending on the timing of wrinkle ridge formation, the topographic
break between Ophir and Aurorae may be a degraded wrinkle ridge.
Subtle channels appear to dissect both plana, and may account for
the theater headed depression incised on Capri Chasma.  Potentially,
the wrinkle ridge may have been present and blocked the topmost
Coprates flow from entering Aurorae.
</p>

<p>
If we assume that the at least 70&nbsp;m thick unit at the Capri
Chasma rim underlies the <a href="#Witbeck_VM_Geologic_Map">Witbeck
et&nbsp;al. (1991)</a> smooth material unit (Hpl<sub>3</sub>,
<a href="#coprates_geomap">Fig.&nbsp;20</a>) of Aurorae Planum, its
volume would be at least 4000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>, more than that
if it also underlies some portion of Ophir Planum.  However, this
unit is not a single lava flow, but many individual flows (we
estimate each at tens of meters thick) layered on top of one another.
</p>

<p>
The south rim of Coprates Chasma shows no evidence for the topmost
strong layer seen on the north rim and in the massif.  Its absence
may be partially responsible for the varying elevation of the south
rim in this area. Erosional processes could act on the less resistant
materials exposed here that are capped to the north by the topmost
strong layer.  The massif retains its flat-topped plateau remnants
because that topmost strong layer and to a lesser extent the next
resistant unit below it have been capping the massif against erosion,
and strengthening it against mass wasting.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the next most competent unit seen in the massif and
the north rim are not identified here (possibly because its morphologic
indicators are buried by talus).  Geologic mapping suggests that
older material is exposed at the surface south of Coprates Chasma,
except some Hr east of the Coprates rise.  The area was probably
active during the early Hesperian (<a href="#1994JGR....99.8371S">Schultz
and Tanaka, 1994</a>).  We think that these sequences are not present
in the south rim simply because they did not get that far south
during emplacement.  There are many possible reasons for this, one
possible hypothesis is that it was due to differential timing in
the opening of the chasma.  Perhaps the trough between what is now
the massif and the south rim opened, then the strong layer was
emplaced over the area of the plateau north of this proto-chasma,
and then later the trough that separated the massif and the north
rim opened.
</p>

<p>
The concept of a kilometers deep megaregolith a few kilometers below
the surface (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="#1979JGR....84.2995C">Carr, 1979</a>,
pp.&nbsp;3000-3001; <a href="#1989LPSC...19..383T">Tanaka and
Golombek, 1989</a>, p.&nbsp;386; <a href="#1990JGR....9514231D">Davis
and Golombek, 1990</a>, pp.&nbsp;14,244-14,245; <a
href="#1993JGR....9810973C">Clifford, 1993</a>, p.&nbsp;10,975) no
longer seems viable (<a href="#1999Nature.McEwen">McEwen et&nbsp;al.,
1999</a>) in this area, where high rates of volcanism may have
occurred during the Noachian and early Hesperian.  The megaregolith
may be present where early and middle Noachian surfaces were being
heavily bombarded and gardened and not buried by ongoing volcanism.
The topmost strong layer observed in Coprates Chasma, and the
resistant sequence that forms the Capri Chasma rim show that
indurated, bedded units are just below the plateau surfaces.  These
resistant layers are topped by a variable thickness of mantling
material (less than 100&nbsp;m).  There are a few images where there
may be a hint of bedding in this material, but it mostly appears
fine-grained and massive at MOC resolution.
</p>

<p>
The individual strong layer that we see near the top of the layered
stack of materials in this portion of Coprates Chasma is the
exception, not the norm.  We do not observe another individual layer
by itself of this thickness, competency, or extent farther down-section
in the strata where it crops out, although such individual layers
would be readily covered by talus.  More resistant bedded sequences
are observed farther down-section that have a darker tone than
surrounding units, and also form more resistant knobs and spurs.
In locations not obscured by talus and mantling between these
resistant units we observe lighter-toned, finely bedded units which
are not as resistant to erosion.  It is this material which appears
to make up the largest part of the stratigraphic stack.
</p>

<p>
This dichotomy of strength in the slope materials is evident in the
distribution of blocks within eastern Coprates Chasma.  There is
certainly an observational bias based on where there are images
with resolutions better than 4&nbsp;m/pixel, but blocks are only
observed downslope of resistant layers.  If entire slopes were
composed primarily of resistant volcanic layers, we might expect a
larger amount of observed blocks.  Similarly, if the materials that
formed the slopes were devoid of cliff-forming material, then no
blocks should be seen.  The fact that they are observed downslope
of dark-toned, layered outcrops, indicates that these units are
indeed relatively strong, but also infrequent in the stratigraphic
stack.  Lava breaks into blocks about the thickness of the lava
unit, or the size of columnar joints within that unit (<a
href="#2003LPI....34.2120M">Milazzo et&nbsp;al., 2003</a>).  Blocks
are not seen everywhere a resistant layer crops out perhaps because
they are buried by talus, or roll down the slope so far that they
are broken into smaller fragments.  This lack of blocks is not
surprising because it is rare on the Earth for such large blocks
to be transported far without disruption.
</p>

<h2><a name="conclusions">5 Conclusions</a></h2>

<p>
Our observations indicate that the stratigraphy of Coprates Chasma
consists of alternating thin (tens of meters) sequences of strong
layers and thicker (hundreds of meters) sequences of relatively
weak layers.  The presence and extent of the infrequent strong
layers which maintain steeper slopes have a large impact on chasma
and slope morphology and that of the surrounding plana.  Different
combinations of strong and weak layers may have some impact into
the varying morphologic character of chasmata within the Valles
Marineris, as well as the locations and sizes of landslides.  This
difference in strength properties could also explain the paucity
of observed boulders and blocks on Valles Marineris slopes if the
thin strong layers are the only source of boulder-sized and larger
particles.
</p>

<p>
Our ability to confidently trace layers decreases with decreasing
elevation and slope.  Layers near the top of the stack are easy to
identify because they are not covered by talus.  Similarly, mantling
deposits can easily cloak outcrops of a strong unit on a relatively
smooth slope, whereas just around a spur that same unit can be
easily identified as a cliff former.
</p>

<p>
Understanding the stratigraphy has also led us to identify a strong
layer near the top of the stratigraphic stack both in the north
slope of eastern Coprates Chasma, and near the crest of the massif
there.  This massif is notable because it is one of the rare
free-standing massifs within the Valles Marineris to retain its
original flat-topped plateau surface.  The massif preserves this
surface because the strong layers are helping the massif resist
erosion and collapse.
</p>

<p>
The elevation offset between the outcrops of this layer in the
northern chasma slope and its outcrops in the massif indicate
subsidence of the massif, most likely due to extensional fault
motion.  There are several models for how the Valles Marineris
formed, including different combinations of rifting, collapse, and
mass wasting.  These observations confirm that extensional faulting
was a contributing factor in the formation of this portion of
Coprates Chasma.
</p>

<p>
It is still difficult to determine the origin of the less competent
layers that make up the majority of the stratigraphic sequence of
the Valles Marineris.  Whether these layers in the Valles Marineris
are fluvial, aeolian, or volcanic sedimentary layers, thin lava
layers, welded tuff layers, or some combination of these, their
contrast to the occasional strong units indicates a change in either
the volcanic source or environmental conditions when these layers
were emplaced.
</p>

<p>
The observations of the topmost strong layer in eastern Coprates
Chasma indicate that the last basaltic lava flow in this area covered
at least 7000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and possibly an increased
area that consists of a large portion of Ophir Planum, either prior
to or during chasma formation.  The boundary between Ophir and
Aurorae Plana may be the easternmost extent of this layer.  Similarly,
outcrops along Capri Chasma indicate that the Aurorae Planum surface
is underlain by a stack of resistant layers that is also present
stratigraphically below the strong layer which outcrops in eastern
Coprates Chasma.  These resistant layers are buried by 100&nbsp;m
or less of mantling material, which obscures the transition between
the plana.
